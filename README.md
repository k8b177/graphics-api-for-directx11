# graphics-api-for-directx11
A user-friendly API for creating 3D graphics built in C++ and using DirectX 11.

****Navigate to **DemoScene/src** to see the code for my API.

****The .cpp file **DemoScene/src/DXApp.cpp** demonstrates how a user would use the API to set up a 3D scene.  (In this case, I created a gas station in space with some pink lighting).
